# nginx-rtmp-docker
A personal re-edition of nginx-rtmp-docker, for my personal use. Thanks to @tiangolo.

## How to use

* For the simplest case, just run a container with this image:

```bash
docker run -d -p 1935:1935 -p 8080:8080 --name nginx-rtmp tiangolo/nginx-rtmp
```

## How to test with OBS Studio and VLC

* Run a container with the command above


* Open [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)
* Click the "Settings" button
* Go to the "Stream" section
* In "Stream Type" select "Custom Streaming Server"
* In the "URL" enter the `rtmp://<ip_of_host>/live` replacing `<ip_of_host>` with the IP of the host in which the container is running. For example: `rtmp://192.168.0.30/live`
* In the "Stream key" use a "key" that will be used later in the client URL to display that specific stream. For example: `test`
* Click the "OK" button
* In the section "Sources" click the "Add" button (`+`) and select a source (for example "Screen Capture") and configure it as you need
* Click the "Start Streaming" button


* Open a [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) player (it also works in Raspberry Pi using `omxplayer`)
* Click in the "Media" menu
* Click in "Open Network Stream"
* Enter the URL from above as `rtmp://<ip_of_host>/live/<key>` replacing `<ip_of_host>` with the IP of the host in which the container is running and `<key>` with the key you created in OBS Studio. For example: `rtmp://192.168.0.30/live/test`
* Click "Play"
* Now VLC should start playing whatever you are transmitting from OBS Studio
